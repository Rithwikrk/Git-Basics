What is ssh in git and why its used insted of https ?

ssh - secure shell host

https - uses username & password for each push.
ssh - it uses keys (public and private keys)

- connecting host with help of public-keys [ host : machine that want to connect ]
- with the help of public key , private key control the host and communicate.

for ssh connection in system :

in local (VS-code) --> terminal : ssh-keygen [for new key-generation]
-passphrase : password for ssh keys (up to you)

code - this cmd will open a new code window

code location-of-key :
it will open a new window --> name.pub - which-one has .pub extension it will be your public-key
the other one will be private key.(with-out extension)

copy the public-key --> go to git-hub--> settings --> SSH&GPG keys :
give a title , paste the public-key then add ssh.

after this connection setup - copy the SSH link --> go to local terminal : git clone ssh-link folder_name

connection will be done.
